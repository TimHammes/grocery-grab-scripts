# grocery-grab-scripts
 
 Grocery Grab is a VR grocery store simulation I have been creating with a group of other developers for a client project using Unity. I designed, built, and programmed the functionality for the shopping cart and the self checkout assets. This repository is a collection of the scripts I coded myself or contributed to.
